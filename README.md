# Encryption and Decryption Algorithms in C#

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive implementation of various encryption and decryption algorithms, developed in C#. It serves as a robust toolkit for anyone interested in understanding and applying cryptographic techniques. The project covers a wide range of both classical and modern cryptographic methods, providing a solid foundation for both educational and practical purposes.

## Features

### Modern Cryptography
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):** A widely used symmetric encryption algorithm that provides strong security for sensitive data.
- **DES (Data Encryption Standard):** An older symmetric-key algorithm that has been widely used in the past but is now considered less secure compared to AES.
- **Diffie-Hellman:** A method for securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel.
- **MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5):** A hashing function that produces a 128-bit hash value, commonly used for data integrity verification.

### Classical Cryptography
- **Autokey Vigenère Cipher:** An extension of the Vigenère cipher, which uses a keyword and the plaintext to generate the encryption key.
- **Columnar Transposition Cipher:** A form of transposition cipher that arranges plaintext into a grid and reads it by columns.
- **Caesar Cipher:** One of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
- **Hill Cipher:** A polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra, using matrix multiplication to encrypt blocks of text.
- **Playfair Cipher:** A digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters, increasing security compared to monoalphabetic ciphers.
- **Rail Fence Cipher:** A transposition cipher that writes the plaintext in a zigzag pattern on an imaginary fence, then reads it off in a linear sequence.

## Programming Language Used
- **C#:** The primary programming language used to implement the algorithms
